# Boston Valuation Tool

A simple home price valuation tool which uses sklearn and a 1970's dataset
of home prices in Boston to create a prediction model using an sklearn Linear Regression Model.

Naively converts the outcome to price in today's USD using the Zillow median price
for boston homes.

Created as part of Phillipp Muellauer, and Angela Yu's [Complete 2020 Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp
